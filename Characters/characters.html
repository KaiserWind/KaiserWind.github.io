                <h2>Trailblazer</h2>
                <p>A boy who boarded the Astral Express. Despite their seemingly synthetic creation, the Trailblazer takes the resemblance of human with silver hair. He chose to travel with the Astral Express to eliminate the dangers posed by the Stellaron. The Trailblazer consistently upholds a composed and impartial demeanor, yet occasionally interjects with remarks of a serious, unrelated, or humorous nature, even in the face of serious situations.</p>

                <h2>March 7th</h2>
                <p>A spirited, quirky young girl who is into all the things girls her age should be interested in, for example, taking photos. She was awakened from a piece of drifting eternal ice only to find out that she knows nothing about herself or her past. While initially in low spirits due to her lack of identity, she decided to name herself after the date she came into this new life. And thus, on that day, March 7th was born.</p>

Years later, Himeko finally repaired the train and began her journey to the stars, but she realized that this was only the beginning. On her trailblazing journey, she would need many more companions. And while they may have different destinations, they all gaze at the same starry sky.</p>
