        <h2>Hello! Trailblazers!</h2><br>
        <p>
            The game is set in a science-fantasy universe in which humanity and other sentient beings follows the paths of beings called Aeons. The player character, the Trailblazer, whose name and gender are chosen by the player, awakens without their memory aboard a space station and discovers that they are imbued with a Stellaron, a disruptive cosmic entity. They join a band of adventurers, the Trailblazers, traveling from world to world aboard the Astral Express, their space train.
            <br><br>
            The Trailblazer wakes up and meets two members of the crew, March 7th and Dan Heng. Both are traveling on the Astral Express, a large cosmic train that travels the universe along the eponymous "Star Rail". After eliminating the remaining threats, the Trailblazer meets Himeko, the Astral Express's navigator, and Welt, an interstellar traveler from the Honkai Impact 3rd world. In an attempt to discover their origins and eliminate the threats of the remaining Stellarons, the Trailblazer departs with the Astral Express crew. 
            <br><br>
            Their first destination is Jarilo-VI, a planet that has been mostly ravaged by the Eternal Freeze, an uninhabitable winter due to the power of a Stellaron. As the crew nears the capital city of Belobog to resolve the Stellaron affair, they are declared fugitives by Supreme Guardian Cocolia due to a mysterious voice from the Stellaron, and escape underground where they learn of the peacekeeping Wildfire and their ongoing conflict with Svarog, the leader of the robots, who has repeatedly rejected peace talks. After settling their differences, the crew returns to the surface to face Cocolia, who merges herself with the Stellaron. The crew defeats her, and Bronya, Cocoliaâ€™s adoptive daughter, takes her place as the new Supreme Guardian while announcing plans to bridge the two areas.
            <br><br>
            Following the conclusion of the Jarilo-VI storyline, the crew receives a signal from Kafka, who wants the crew to settle a Stellaron incident on the Xianzhou Luofu. As they arrive, they are not permitted to assist in Stellaron affairs but are instead tasked by Cloud Knight general Jing Yuan to weed out Kafka and her Stellaron Hunter cohort Blade, as their presence on the ship is deemed a threat. Upon the crew finding Kafka, she revealed that her job was finished the moment the Trailblazer arrived on the Xianzhou Luofu, an action foreseen by her boss, Elio. With the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and Lord Ravager Phantylia now out of the shadows, Dan Heng reveals his Imbibitor Lunae lineage and assists Jing Yuan and the rest of the Trailblazers in fighting her, resulting in her temporary retreat. 
            <br><br>
            After the end of the conflict with Phantylia, Jing Yuan formally creates an alliance between the Xianzhou and Astral Express, gifting a jade abacus as a symbol of their mutual friendship. Dan Feng's imprisonment edict is annulled by Jing Yuan, giving Dan Heng his freedom onboard the Luofu.
